## What is Gear Lever
Gear Lever is a free and open-source AppImage manager for Linux that makes it easy to install, organize, and manage AppImages.

While AppImages offer a convenient, portable way to run applications across different Linux distributions without installation, managing multiple AppImage files can quickly become cumbersome. Each AppImage must be manually executed, lacks automatic integration with your application menu, and updates must be tracked manually.

Gear Lever addresses these issues by providing a centralized hub for all your AppImages.
